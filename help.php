    <h3 style="text-align: left">About Chart of Accounts</h3>
    <p style="text-align: left">A chart of accounts (COA) is an organized list of all financial accounts in a company's general ledger, used to classify, record, and summarize financial transactions for reporting and analysis. It acts as the framework for financial reporting by providing an index of accounts like assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses, each assigned a unique code for consistent tracking and decision-making.</p>
    <h3 style="text-align: left">About Accounts</h3>
    <p style="text-align: left">In an accounting system, an account is a record of financial transactions for a specific item, such as cash, accounts receivable, or rent expense. These accounts are organized into a chart of accounts which categorizes all of a company's financial data, typically into five main types: assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses. Each transaction affects at least two accounts, following the double-entry accounting system, to maintain a balanced financial record.</p>
    <h3 style="text-align: left">About Ledgers</h3>
    <p style="text-align: left">In an accounting system, a ledger is a central record of all financial transactions, organized by account type. It acts as a master file or "book of accounts," which is used to create financial statements and is essential for tracking a company's assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses.</p>
